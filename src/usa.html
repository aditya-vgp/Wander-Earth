          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The White House has been the seat of the US government and home of Presidents of the United States of America for over 200 years.

            Original construction of the White House began in October 1792 after President George Washington chose what is now 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as the location for the new home of the federal government. The White House was not yet completed when, in 1800, it housed its first ‘first family’ President John Adams and First Lady, Abigail Adams.
            <br /><br />
            The White House Visitors Centre is also a source of White House history, including details of the building’s architecture and history. A tour of the visitors centre should take between 20 minutes and an hour.

            Gettysburg National Military Park is brimming with approximately 1,328 monuments, markers and memorials relating to the American Civil War. The Battle of Gettysburg raged from 1 to 3 July 1863, resulting in over 51,000 casualties and victory for the Unionists. It marked a significant turning point in the war, followed twenty one months later by the surrender of the Confederacy.
            <br /><br />
            Visitors can follow the route of Battle of Gettysburg, from Seminary Ridge and Culp’s Hill to Cemetery Ridge and Devils Den as well as visiting David Wills’ house, a museum about the town. The National Park Service Museum and Visitor Center is a good place to start as it contains a wide range of Civil War related information as well as a plethora of guided tours and exhibitions.

            The Lincoln Memorial is a Greek style monument in Washington DC’s West Potomac Park. The Lincoln Memorial was designed by the architect, Henry Bacon, who also sculpted the statue of Lincoln which visitors can see within its walls.
            <br /><br />
            As the site of many important political speeches and events, Lincoln Memorial has a history of its own, independent from its original purpose. In particular, it was the site where Martin Luther King delivered his famous “I Have A Dream” speech on 28 August 1963.

            Mesa Verde National Park is a breathtaking Native American site dotted with over 4,000 archaeological treasures, including 600 exceptionally well preserved cliff dwellings dating back to 600 AD. Mesa Verde National Park was once the home of the Pueblos, a Native American people who lived there for over 700 years before migrating to New Mexico and Arizona.
            <br /><br />
            Some of the sites, such as the Cliff Palace and Balcony House with its over 150 rooms can only be viewed as part of a ranger tour, for which you can buy tickets at Far View Visitor Center before attending the sites. It’s also well worth viewing the large collection of artefacts on display.

            The Statue of Liberty is an iconic copper and steel statue in the entrance to New York Habour and an enduring symbol of freedom and independence. The Statue of Liberty’s total height from ground to torch is a staggering 92.99 metres. Originally built in France in 1884, it arrived in New York in June 1885 and was dedicated on 28 October 1886.
            <br /><br />
            Situated on Liberty Island, there are numerous exhibits and tours available both inside and outside the Statue of Liberty. Upon reaching Liberty Island, visitors can go to the information station to watch a short film about the statue’s history and check the schedule of events for one of 45 minute long ranger tours, which start at the Liberty Island Flagpole.

            Independence Hall in Philadelphia is one of the most important landmarks in US history, being the site where the nation declared independence from Great Britain on 4 July 1776. The hall is now part of Independence National Historical Park, which also encompasses a myriad of important sites such as Congress Hall and Liberty Bell Centre sprawled over 55 acres within the City of Philadelphia.
            <br /><br />
            Visitors can choose from a variety of ranger guided walking tours as well as various indoor and outdoor activities. Across the road is the Liberty Bell Centre, housing the famous Liberty Bell, one of the most significant symbols of the American Civil War and formerly hung in Independence Hall’s tower. Congress Hall is next door to Independence Hall.

            It was in Historic Jamestowne in 1607 that the English established their first successful colony in America. Previous attempts, notably that of Roanoke in 1587, had been made, but the colony the English formed in Jamestowne was the root of what was to eventually become America.
            <br /><br />
            Today, Jamestowne forms part of Colonial National Park, a historic site which encompasses York Town Battlefield, Colonial Parkway and the Cape Henry Memorial. Visitors can explore the history of the site and that of the country as a whole. Amongst its many attractions, it is worth seeing the Jamestown Glasshouse, a recreation of the first industrial building of the Virginia Company, the London-based company that founded the colony.

            The Freedom Trail takes visitors to Boston through a tour of sixteen sites in the city which were of importance before and during the American Revolution against British rule in the 18th century.

            Boston played a central role in igniting the American Revolution, also known as the American War of Independence, and the Freedom Trail contains the sites which tell its story.
            <br /><br />
            The Freedom Trail is a 2.5 mile trip which visitors can either follow independently using the red pavement markings around the city or join one of the selections of guided tours, which last around an hour and a half.

                  passengers and crew. Be sure to give the airline your current
                  contact information when booking your ticket so you can be
                  notified if you are exposed to a sick traveler on a flight.

                  Yes. The chance of getting COVID-19 on cruise ships is high
                  because the virus spreads easily between people in close
                  quarters on board ships. For this reason, CDC recommends the
                  following groups of people avoid traveling on cruise ships,
                  including river cruises, worldwide.
