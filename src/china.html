            Located in Luoyang, Henan Province located in central China, the Longmen Grottoes is famed as the biggest grottoes in China, containing the most amount of Buddha sculptures. Firstly being built in 493AD, this huge project lasted about 1,400 years and ended during the Qing Dynasty.The carvings and workmanship are outstanding. Ancient Buddha sculptures dot the caves yielding up surprises at every turn.
            <br /><br />
            About 25% of the 100,000 statues are undamaged. The largest statue was commissioned by the first female emperor of China - Wu ZeTian. The grottoes extend for more than one kilometer along the bank of the Yihe River. It’s well worth crossing the bridge to view the grotto from the other side to get a wide-angle perspective of the whole grotto. It is recommended to visit the site in the morning, as when the sun goes down at the back of the mountain, the statues are darkened.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Qufu in Shandong Province is the hometown of Confucius. The San Kong Site (Three Confucius Sites) includes the Confucius Temple, Mansion, and Cemetery. The former two sites are next to each other, and the third one is in a 15-minute walk. There are Confucius temples in many cities in China, but this one is the biggest.
            <br /><br />
            Lots of school children visit to pray for good performance in school as Confucius is seen as the greatest educator and philosopher. For historians and scholars, it’s the most sacred place to study Confucianism and Chinese history.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Shaolin Temple has become a very popular spot for Kungfu lovers ever since Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan’s Kungfu movies were big hits in the west. As the birthplace of both Chinese martial arts and Zen Buddhism, it receives hundreds of millions of pilgrims and visitors from home and abroad every year. The temple comprises multiple buildings and courtyards, the training center, the show hall, and the Pagoda Forest.
            <br /><br />
            It is the place to learn the history of martial arts (Kungfu) and how Zen Buddhism spread across China. Watching the young monks learning and practicing is a lot more real and interesting than watching a Kungfu fiction or an acrobatic show. You can reach the temple by driving from Zhengzhou, the capital city, or Luoyang, where the Longmen Grottoes are located.

                  Yes. The chance of getting COVID-19 on cruise ships is high
                  because the virus spreads easily between people in close
