          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Undoubtedly, the most famous monument in Greece is the Acropolis of Athens. The Acropolis is an ancient citadel located on rocky, elevated ground in the center of the city of Athens, containing the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historic significance. There is evidence that the hill was inhabited as early as the fourth millennium B.C.
            <br /><br />
            However, it was Pericles, in the second half of the fifth century B.C. that coordinated the construction of the site’s most important buildings, among them, being the Parthenon, the Propylaea, the Erechteion, and the Temple of Athena Nike. Today the site is an official cultural UNESCO World Heritage site.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Delphi was a sacred precinct that was considered by the ancient Greeks as the center of the world, marked by a stone monument called the omphalos (navel). From the 8th century BC, the site served as the seat of Pythia, the major oracle that was consulted about important decisions throughout the ancient world, being international in character.
            <br /><br />
            The site was built on the south-western slope of Mount Parnassus and its management was in the hands of an amphictyony, a committee of persons chosen mainly from Central Greece. The fact that every important ancient Greek city-state built various monuments on the site proves that Delphi had a significant influence in ancient Greece.

            Meteora is a rock formation in central Greece which serves as the building place of one of the largest and most steeply built complexes of Eastern Orthodox monasteries, being second in importance only to Mount Athos.
            <br /><br />
            Considered as one of the most important historical sites in Greece, Meteora hosts six monasteries built on immense natural pillars and hill-like rounded boulders, with the earliest traces of their history being dated back to the 11th century, when the first hermits settled in the area. Some of the most important religious sites in Meteora are the Holy Monastery of Great Meteoron, the Holy Monastery of Varlaam, the Holy Monastery of Rousanou, and the Monastery of Holy Trinity.

It is located in the north-east Peloponnese, and it was one of the major centers of Greek civilization during the second millennium BC, with its military dominating much of southern Greece, Crete, and the Cyclades. Mycenae was probably built between 1350 and 1200 BC, during the peak of the Mycenaean civilization.
            <br /><br />
            Some of the most important monuments found on the site are the Cyclopean walls, the Lion gate, chamber tombs, and the palace ruins.

            Among the many great monuments, there is the Sanctuary of Asklepios, the temple of Artemis, the Tholos, the Enkoimeterion, and the Propylaia, all illustrating the significance and the power of the healing gods of the Hellenic and Roman worlds. The theater of Epidaurus is considered an architectural masterpiece that is still in use today.

            Pella is an ancient city located in central Macedonia and it is best known as the historical capital of the ancient kingdom of Macedon. During the 4th century BC, under Phillip II and Alexander the city became a metropolis with a spectacular complex of palaces and rich private houses. The city also boasted the biggest agora in the ancient world.
            <br /><br />
            At the site, you can see the remains of many types of buildings, paved streets, and private houses built in Doric and Ionic style. There are also the remains of the city’s brick walls, sophisticated sewer systems, and the sanctuaries of Athena, Poseidon, Herakles, and Aphrodite, among others.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Messene was an ancient Greek city-state located in the Peloponnese. It was founded by Epaminondas in 369 BC, over the ruins of Ithome, an ancient city originally built by Achaean Greeks. After the battle of Leuctra and the first Theban invasion of the Peloponnese, Epaminondas invited all the people that had gone into exile from the area after the long wars and servitude under Sparta, to resettle the city.
            <br /><br />
            Today, the ancient site has attracted significant historical attention. Many public buildings have been excavated in the area. Among them, the Asklepieion complex, a small theater, the Bouleuterion, and a part of the wall. There you can also see the remains of the Temple of Artemis Limniatis and the Sanctuary of Zeus Ithomatas.

                  Yes. The chance of getting COVID-19 on cruise ships is high
                  because the virus spreads easily between people in close
