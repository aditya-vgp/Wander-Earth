          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Built in lush, mountainous terrain high above the Urubamba River,
            Machu Picchu lies in one of the most stunning settings of any
            archeological site in the world. This ancient city of Incas cascades
            down steep walls on each side of the mountain, with terraced steps
            that disappear over cliff edges into the valley below.
            <br /><br />
            These incredible ruins have been restored and are well maintained,
            giving visitors a good indication of what the city might have looked
            like when it was occupied during the 15th and 16th centuries.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Thousands of ancient temples and stupas stretch endlessly across the
            landscape at Bagan, where the silhouette of the temple spires
            against the sky in the early morning or late day is a magical sight.
            The area is known for having the largest concentration of Buddhist
            temples in the world, many of which were built in the 1000s and
            1100s, when it was the capital of the Pagan Kingdom.
            <br /><br />
            Some of these have been restored, and others are little more than
            ruins. They also range in size and level of sophistication, creating
            an intriguing mix of structures that make visitors want to keep
            exploring the site.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            One of the most iconic sites in the world, the Pyramids of Giza,
            just outside Cairo, are a surreal sight rising from the barren
            desert landscape. Standing guard nearby, and almost as impressive,
            is the Sphinx, gazing blankly out over the land. The pyramids were
            built as tombs for the Pharaohs, the largest of which was
            constructed between 2560 and 2540 BC.
            <br /><br />
            To put their age in perspective, they were already more than 2,600
            years old when the Colosseum in Rome was being built. Today, these
            giant monuments are the sole surviving member of the Seven Wonders
            of the Ancient World.

            In a unique jungle setting, not far from the city of Siem Reap,
            Angkor Wat is known for being the world's largest religious
            monument, but it is more than sheer size that makes the Angkor
            complex so interesting. The site was built by the Khmers in the 12th
            century, and the architecture is nothing less than stunning.
            <br /><br />
            The site has an intriguing mix of excavated and unexcavated temples
            in varying shapes, sizes, and states of decay, with some buildings
            taking on a mystical appearance as they're swallowed up by trees and

            Stretching almost 6,000 kilometers as it snakes its way through
            forests and mountains, the Great Wall of China is one of those
            undeniable bucket list sites that have long inspired great
            adventures. This massive wall, connecting battlements and
            watchtowers, was built over the centuries, with the oldest sections
            dating back to the 7th century BC.
            <br /><br />
            Today, you can opt to simply visit the wall on a day trip from
            Beijing, or tackle whole sections of it on organized, multi-day
            trips. Some sections of the wall have been restored, while other
            sections are badly in need of repair.

            One of the most recognizable structures in the world, the Roman
            Colosseum is the largest building remaining from Roman times. Its
            imposing presence in the city center of modern day Rome is a
            testament to the incredible history of the city and the achievements
            of the Roman Empire.
            <br /><br />
            Visitors popping up from the nearest subway stop or turning a corner
            and seeing it for the first time can't help but be stunned by its
            immense presence. Construction began on the structure in AD 72 and
            today, it is still one of the greatest tourist attractions in the
            world.

            Towering over the city of Athens from its hilltop perch, the
            Acropolis stands as a proud monument to Ancient Greece. Dating from
            between the 5th and 4th century BC and dominating the site, the
            Parthenon is the largest and most recognizable structure from this
            period and symbolizes the extensive history of this country.
            <br /><br />
            Just steps away from modern day Athens, the Acropolis is a powerful
            sight, glistening in the Mediterranean sun during the day and lit
            for dramatic effect at night. For first-time visitors to the city,
            it is an awe inspiring sight and sets the stage for travelers
            carrying on to other parts of Greece.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            This incredible prehistoric monument is one of the United Kingdom's
            most visited attractions and certainly one of its most unique places
            to visit, drawing huge numbers of visitors each year. The monument
            is thought to have been erected between 3000-1500 BC, but there is
            no record of its origin or purpose, leading to all kinds of
            speculation and myths, some of which suggest religious or
            astronomical significance.
            <br /><br />
            As a result, the Bronze Age ring of standing stones holds an almost
            mystical fascination, particularly around the summer and winter
            solstices, when the light from the sunrise and sunset is aligned
            with the stones.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Borobudur is one of the most important Buddhist sites in the world
            and certainly one of Indonesia's most famous landmarks. Set in lush,
            tropical surroundings, with mountains and volcanoes rising in the
            distance, the site is visually stunning and soothingly peaceful.
            <br /><br />
            Located on the island of Java, near Yogyakarta, this massive temple
            complex was constructed in the 700s, but two to three hundred years
            later, the site was abandoned, possibly due to volcanic eruptions in
            the area, and went relatively undisturbed for centuries.

            Mesa Verde is home to one of the most visually stunning
            archeological sites in the USA and some of the most well preserved
            Indian ruins in North America. The most impressive sites are the
            cliff dwellings tucked precariously into the canyon walls, but the
            entire area, including the forest covered plateau, contains a vast
            array of ruins.
            <br /><br />
            The Ancestral Puebloans inhabited this area of what is now Colorado
            for hundreds of years, living on top of the plateau between the 6th
            and 12th centuries and then in the cliff dwellings until the late
            13th century. The drive up to the site is along a gently twisting
            road to the top of the mesa, where you can tour the sites on the
            plateau by car to see pit houses and other ruins, and enjoy stunning
            views of the dwellings in the canyon walls.
