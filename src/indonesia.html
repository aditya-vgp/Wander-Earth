            Next historical building in Indonesia is the Fort Rotterdam. It is a
            fortress located in Makassar, South Sulawesi Province and is a relic
            from the Dutch colonial era. Even so, the fact is that this building
            was not built by the Dutch, but was built by the Gowa Kingdom which
            later fell into the hands of the invaders in 1667.
            <br /><br />
            Previously, this fort had the name of Ujung Pandang Fortress.
            However, the name was changed by the Dutch into Fort Rotterdam. Of
            course at that time the Indonesian couldn’t stay still and tried to
            retake this fortress led by the fighters Sultan Hasanuddin.

            Borobudur Temple, Magelang
          </h6>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Borobudur is a Buddhists Temple that stands in a special location.
            Why so? Because of its location flanked by two pairs of mountains
            which are the Mount Merapi and Mount Merbabu, and Mount Sumbing and
            Mount Sindoro. This beautiful Borobudur Temple is situated in
            Magelang, Central Java Province.
            <br /><br />
            Uniquely, the work of the Borobudur Temple at that time did not use
            any adhesive. The material used was volcanic beams and the
            magnificent Borobudur Temple still stands strong until now.

            Prambanan Temple or Roro Jonggrang Temple, located in the Special
            Region of Yogyakarta, is the largest Hindu Temple complex in
            Indonesia which was built in the 9th century AD. This temple is
            dedicated to the Trimurti, the three main Hindu deities namely
            Brahma as the creator god, Vishnu as the guardian god, and Shiva as
            the god of destruction. On the walls of each temple, you can see
            reliefs that tell interesting Hindu epics to follow.
